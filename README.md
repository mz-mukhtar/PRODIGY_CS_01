## Theoretical Overview

The **Caesar Cipher** is one of the oldest and simplest forms of encryption.  
It works by shifting each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.

For example, with a shift of `3`:

~~~
Plain: HELLO
Cipher: KHOOR
~~~


Decryption reverses the shift using the same key:

~~~
Cipher: KHOOR
Plain: HELLO
~~~
